# Java DSA Interview Prep

This repository is my personal learning and tracking space to master **Java fundamentals** and **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)** in preparation for coding interviews, especially for **SDET roles**.

---

## 🎯 Goals

- Strengthen core Java understanding (OOP, Collections, Concurrency, etc.)
- Build problem-solving skills with structured DSA practice
- Track learning progress using organized folders and a problem tracker
- Prepare for technical interviews in QA/SDET and developer roles

## ⚙️ How to Run Java Code

> You can use **any of the following methods** to run Java files inside the `src/` folder:

### 1. IDE (Recommended)
- Use **IntelliJ IDEA**, **VS Code** with Java extensions, or **Eclipse**.
- Open the repo folder and run Java files directly.

### 2. Command Line (Manual)
```bash
cd src/basics
javac HelloWorld.java
java HelloWorld
```

## 📈 Problem Tracker

Use the `problem-tracker.csv` to track progress on each topic/problem.

### Example Format:

| ID  | Topic       | Problem Name        | Status        | Notes                   |
|-----|-------------|--------------------|---------------|-------------------------|
| 001 | basics      | Hello World        | ✅ Done       | Java setup and syntax    |
| 002 | collections | ArrayList Example  | 🟡 In Progress| Review methods and usage |

## 🛣️ Learning Path

> This is the roadmap I’m following to go from beginner to interview-ready:

1. ✅ Java Basics
2. 🔜 Java Collections
3. 🔜 Arrays & Strings
4. 🔜 Linked Lists
5. 🔜 Stacks & Queues
6. 🔜 Trees
7. 🔜 Recursion & Backtracking
8. 🔜 Sorting & Searching
9. 🔜 Dynamic Programming
10. 🔜 Concurrency & Threading (for SDET prep)

## 🧠 Interview Prep Tips

- Focus on understanding the **“why”** behind each solution.
- Start from **easy-level** problems and build confidence.
- Practice solving in a **time-bound** manner once comfortable.
- For SDET roles, write code that is **clean, modular, and testable**.
- Practice explaining your solution out loud — interviewers care about your approach!
